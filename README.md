# Digital Accessibility Resources

## Official statistics on disability and web accessibility

Consider checking the official statistics for the US and the World on disability to understand the impacted population and importance of digital equity for all.

*   [CDC Disability and Health Overview](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/disability.html)
*   [WHO Disability Report 2011](https://www.who.int/disabilities/world_report/2011/report/en/)
*   [The World Bank Disability Inclusion Overview](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/disability)

[The WebAIM Million - An annual accessibility analysis of the top 1,000,000 home pages](https://webaim.org/projects/million/) demonstrates that we are very far from having digital equity for all.


## Official accessibility policies (in-depth)

If you are interested in learning about accessibility policies in-depth or inspired to eventually influence them, read through the following documents.  

List of accessibility laws and policies is available via [Web Accessibility Laws & Policies | Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) | W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/policies/), including the following:

*   Official website for WCAG [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview | Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) | W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) (note: WCAG 3.0 is coming, working draft is available via [W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/WD-wcag-3.0-20210121/)
*   [A Guide to Disability Rights Laws](https://www.ada.gov/cguide.htm)
*   [IT Accessibility Laws and Policies](https://www.section508.gov/manage/laws-and-policies)

## Accessibility check-lists and policies (at-a-glance)

If you don’t want to read through the official policies and laws, consider checking out the accessibility checklist put together by WebAim, available via [WebAIM's WCAG 2 Checklist](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist), or the a11y Project’s checklist, available via [https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/).

Or read through the at-a-glance versions of the official accessibility documents:

*   [WCAG 2.1 at a Glance | Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) | W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/glance/)
*   [How to Meet WCAG (Quickref Reference)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/)
*   [How to Meet WCAG (Quick Reference)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?versions=2.1)

If you are already familiar with WCAG 2.0 and not WCAG 2.1, consider reading [What's New in WCAG 2.1 | Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) | W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-21/).

## Accessibility testing tools (for engineers and QA)

There are a plethora of different accessibility tools that you can use to test your web site or application. Consider running automated tests using a few browser plugins and follow-up with at least one screen reader for each platform and a [keyboard-only navigation](https://webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/) through your main end-user flows. 

If you have more needs or a specific use case, check this curated list of [accessibility evaluation tools](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tools/), provided by W3 that you can filter to find ones that match your particular needs. To determine what kind of tool you need and how they are able to assist you, see [Selecting Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/tools/selecting/).
